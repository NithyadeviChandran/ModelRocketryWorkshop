        Big Bang Workshop is essentially designed to give your kids a new
        dimension of learning. The environment of playfulness will be created in
        classes and our hosts will make kids perform hands-on experiments. Our
        motto is to make education an effortless process and we are intending to
        make it happen in all our classes. Our theme is Rocket Science Workshop
        for this month and the kids will be learning the science behind the
        Rockets, Satellites and Rovers.
